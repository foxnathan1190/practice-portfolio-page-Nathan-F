        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="me.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <p>I am Nathan Fox, I'm a 35 year old zookeeper, origionally from Quincy, IL. but have lived in St. Louis for the past 10 years. I have a beautiful wife, Stephanie, and two dogs, Rusty and Tonks. We have been married since 2020, and yes, we did get married during Covid, and yes, it was a mess. As I said though, I am a zookeeper at the St. Louis Zoo and love animals, especially apes, which I work with. I've been there about 10 years now. In my free time I like to spend time with my wife and dogs, watch movies, play video games, and dungeons and dragons. I am looking to change toward a career in IT and hope LaunchCode can help me get there.</p>
